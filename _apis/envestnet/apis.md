    description: >-
      This guide will show the basics of verifying accounts using Yodlee. Account verification can help enable payments, avoid overdrafts, reduce fraud, and more.  Verifying an account simply means your user has authenticated against the account, and then you get detailed information for the problem you're trying to solve. For instance, for payments, you might want to prove a user has access to an account, get the account routing number, and check the amount of money in it.
