          This endpoint is an interface for initializing a request for an answer from FactSet Mercury, our large language model for surfacing FactSet datasets through conversational natural language queries. Use the `/create` endpoint to start generating responses for one-off questions. Responses contain a chat ID and status for the chat process.
