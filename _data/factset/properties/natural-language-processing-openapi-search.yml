            Matchbox.io Uses Voice-First Games as A Natural Way of Learning

            matchbox.ioCredit: matchbox.io

            Alexa and gaming have been rubbing shoulders since day one. From
            guiding children through LEGO adventures to multi-player trivia
            games for bored drivers, Voice has proven to be the new frontier of
            gaming.

            When voice assistants first bobbed into the mainstream, marketing
            solution architect and data scientist Joel Wilson immediately saw
            the potential of Voice not only for games, but for education. He
            started his venture with the Alexa skill Question of the Day, a
            simple trivia game that poses a different question each day. Over
            4,000 five-star reviews and hundreds of thousands of users later, it
            has become a routine skill for people happy to learn something new
            every day.

            "We're on a mission to enable frictionless learning," Wilson told
            Amazon. "We've just scratched the surface of how we can do that with
            voice-first games."

            Meet matchbox.io

            In 2017, Wilson founded the voice-first gaming company matchbox.io,
            dedicated to creating interactive, educational experiences through
            Amazon Alexa and, more recently, Samsung Bixby. In just a few years,
            matchbox.io has become a recognized leader in educational games on
            voice-first devices.

            With Question of the Day growing into one of the most popular and
            highest rated skills in the Alexa Skill Store, Wilson and his team
            of Data Scientists and Education Innovators immersed themselves in
            helping people learn more about the world through Voice. Before
            long, they launched another educational skill called Kids Quiz.

            Kids Quiz poses new questions every day for children ages 5-12, from
            animals and science to brainteasers and fun facts. They can also
            collect stars and unlock surprises as they go. Another addition to
            the matchbox.io repertoire is Three Questions, which provides, well,
            three questions a day rather than just one. Like their other skills,
            players can earn points and unlock bonus content.

            With three successful voice-first experiences under their belt,
            matchbox.io is marching forward with their mission to leverage Voice
            to disperse a little bit more knowledge to their users every single
            day.


            Why Voice for learning?

            At this point, the question is almost rhetorical. We've seen games
            capture the short attention spans of children, teach stubborn
            students and professionals new skills, and hold the curiosity of
            busy adults for decades. With Voice, the captivating effect of
            gaming is multiplied by the prospect of playing with increasingly
            less effort. There are no controls to untangle (or fight over), no
            keyboard to pound repeatedly, and no limitation for people with
            limited vision or mobility.

            "Voice is the perfect, most accessible interface for gaming," says
            Wilson in an Amazon blog post. "We can tailor the experience to
            customers wants and needs, so they can learn something quick, hear
            more in-depth info about a particular fact, or settle in for an
            extended game play."

            With over 6 million users playing his company's voice-first gaming
            apps, it's clear that the marriage between Voice and traditional
            learning is set for the long-run. The question now is which gaming
            companies will take advantage of it.


            The future of voice-first gaming

            Using Voice for interactive learning is all well and good, but what
            about the business side of things?

            Wilson knows a few things about this too. Feeling confident about
            their skills' continued popularity, they made a move to monetize
            them with In-Skill Purchasing (ISP). This feature allows the company
            to fund the creation of more educational experiences by adding paid,
            premium content to their apps. This way, they can keep their users
            engaged while safely sustaining their business.

            Wilson believes that this is the future of voice-first gaming
            industry. In his eyes, all you need is a good idea, quality content,
            and the smarts to know how and when to monetize it. As voice
            assistants and devices evolve, however, so will the methods to run a
            successful business with them. But Wilson is already dabbling in new
            ways to make his passion for learning and gaming a long-term
            venture.

            "There's still a lot to be explored with Voice gaming," says Wilson.

            To learn so much more about Voice and gaming experiences, you'll be
            excited to know that Wilson will be at VOICE Summit to share design
            and strategy insights alongside equally bright minds from Gamefuly,
            Drivetime, and V Group Inc.

            Advanced Energy Transforms Indoor Farming With Intelligent New
            Lighting Power and Control System Friday, December 11, 2020 01:00:00
            PM (GMT)Innovative technology breaks down barriers to indoor,
            vertical and greenhouse farming by reducing power consumption,
            cutting costs and increasing crop yield Advanced Energy (Nasdaq:
            AEIS) – a global leader in highly engineered, precision power
            conversion, measurement, and control solutions – today unveiled its
            newest lighting and power control system for indoor, vertical and
            greenhouse farming. This press release features multimedia. Advanced
            Energy's new Artesyn iTS provides the industry's first solution for
            switching or sharing a single power source between two different
            rooms. This reduces installation costs by cutting the number of iHP
            power supplies needed in half and it substantially reduces ongoing
            utility costs. (Photo: Business Wire)AE's new lighting and power
            system transforms the use of LED technology in horticultural
            lighting systems, which plays a fundamental role in cutting-edge
            farming practices that can address production challenges in food,
            pharmaceutical ingredients, plants and flowers. Utilizing AE's
            system, customers reduce their power conversion costs by as much as
            50 percent, significantly lower installation and operating costs,
            and increase the quality of crop yield. "Our groundbreaking
            lighting, power and control system delivers significant improvements
            over conventional lighting solutions and opens up new opportunities
            for the industry," said Joe Voyles, vice president, industrial
            marketing, at Advanced Energy. "We are transforming our customers'
            operations by both reducing the amount of needed equipment and
            improving the efficiency of the lighting systems, thereby reducing
            cost and energy spend. Not only do these innovative new products
            increase the efficiency and quality of fruit and vegetable
            production, but they also open the door to establishing indoor
            farming facilities in harsh environments anywhere in the world." The
            new system consists of the patented Artesyn iTS (intelligent
            Transfer Switch) and iHPS configurable power supply. Alongside
            Artesyn's compact new 12 kW 300 VDC module, AE delivers a
            cost-effective platform for the most advanced indoor farming
            applications. The system is estimated to produce a 38 percent
            savings to lighting power and control installation cost, while
            eliminating substantial amounts of wasted energy. The new iHPS is a
            "short" version of AE's market-leading iHP power supply. The shorter
            design allows for more space within the lighting and power cabinet
            for other crucial components, reduces the weight and cost, and
            increases the life of the system. The new iTS provides the
            industry's first solution for switching or sharing a single power
            source between two different rooms. This reduces installation costs
            by cutting the number of iHP power supplies needed in half and it
            substantially reduces ongoing utility costs.

            Studio Entertainment: At Studio Entertainment, operating income
            decreased in the quarter due to lower theatrical distribution and
            home entertainment results. Worldwide theatrical results continued
            to be adversely impacted by COVID-19, as theaters were closed in
            many key markets both domestically and internationally. With no
            significant worldwide theatrical releases in the quarter, we faced a
            difficult comparison against the strong performance of The Lion King
            and Toy Story 4 in the prior-year quarter. Operating Results: On our
            last earnings call, we said that we expected Q4 operating results of
            our DTC businesses to improve by approximately $100mm relative to
            the prior-year quarter. Our results came in better than that
            guidance, with operating income at our DTC businesses improving by
            approximately $300mm vs. the prior year due to better-than-expected
            performance across all three of our streaming services. I will note
