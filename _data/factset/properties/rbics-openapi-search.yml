        Understand the full RBICS Taxonomy Structure through time to help
        organize your analysis or facilitate the use of RBICS in application
        development.


        Designed to overcome disparate and non-standardized company disclosures,
        the RBICS taxonomy is a normalized global industry classification
        consisting of a fourteen-by-six matrix. There are twelve economies with
        two specialty sectors, each with six incremental detailed layers,
        resulting in over 1,600 sector groups.


        The top-levels' market-defined approach groups companies based on their
        behavioral similarities and stock price co-movement, while the patented
        product-based approach used in the lower levels enables the necessary
        precision to capture the specialty sectors of global markets.
